## Introduction

In this project, we utilize the power of machine learning to predict employee salaries. Specifically, we employ the Linear Regression model from sklearn to create a predictive model. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist businesses in estimating employee salaries based on their experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-salary-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install sklearn numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook employee_salary_prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. **Explore the Code:**
   Open the Jupyter Notebook and explore the code to understand how the Linear Regression model is trained and used for predictions.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about employees, including their years of experience and corresponding salaries. It is provided in the `data.csv` file.

## Usage

To use the predictive model:

1. Import the trained model into your own Python script or application.
2. Provide the years of experience as input to the model.
3. Obtain the predicted salary as output.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the trained model (you may need to adjust the file path)
model = joblib.load('trained_model.pkl')

# Provide years of experience for prediction
years_of_experience = 5.0  # Adjust as needed

# Predict the salary
predicted_salary = model.predict([[years_of_experience]])
print(f'Predicted Salary: ${predicted_salary[0]:.2f}')
```

## Results

The project results include:

- A trained Linear Regression model.
- Predicted employee salaries based on years of experience.
- Visualizations and analysis of the data and model performance.
